# Inspectioning the Data

Before preprocessing the data it is needed to understand it, showing its distribution and quantity over the total data. 
As it is described below the class that will be analyzed, or the final result that we want to predict, has a lot of content checked as "other", it can add some dificulty on the processing, as this may not have a specific pattern to find on the archives.

| Content Type | Quantity |
|---|:---:| 
| course | 929 | 
| department | 182 | 
| faculty | 927 | 
| other | 3153 | 
| project | 504 | 
| staff | 137 | 
| student | 1197 |
